# Artist Statement

Write your artist statement in this file (max 200 words).

This perlin noise flow field artwork explores the beauty of fluid motion by flow of particles in different direction. The particles follow a structured and organic path as the fluid lines and curves are smooth, continous suggesting a natural movement like water streams or air currents. There is a coherence and fluidity with the use of perlin noise, noisescale and framecount. 

This artwork is engaging for viewers. A background music starts after clicking on screen. Different sounds are produced on clicking different region. Flow of particles can be changed by clicking on canvas. You can also change the speed of particles by pressing left, up, right arrow key. But, you can get the original flow using down arrow key. You can also change the noise scale range of particles by using ENTER, SHIFT and BACKSPACE key. All of this will also change the sound running in the background. Color of the particles can also be changed only in the default flow by pressing all the keys from 1 to 9 and obtain default color by 0. Dragging the mouse can also change the particles in that area of 45px around it.
